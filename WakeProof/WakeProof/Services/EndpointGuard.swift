//  EndpointGuard.swift
//  WakeProof
//
//  Single source of truth for the hostname allowlist enforced on every
//  outbound Claude-proxy call. Before Wave 2.1 the allowlist lived only
//  inside `ClaudeAPIClient.defaultEndpoint`; `OvernightAgentClient` and
//  `NightlySynthesisClient` derived their base URLs from the same
//  `Secrets.claudeEndpoint` but skipped the host check entirely, so a
//  tampered Secrets value would silently route overnight agent traffic +
//  nightly synthesis to an attacker-controlled host while vision
//  verification still crashed loudly. This file centralises the check and
//  is called by all three clients at launch (preconditionFailure on
//  mismatch — same-fail-mode as the original ClaudeAPIClient guard).
//
//  Adding a new allowed host: append to `allowedHostSuffixes` and document
//  the reason in a one-liner comment. Prefer exact hostnames over wildcard
//  suffixes — the ".vercel.app" suffix is the one concession we make for
//  preview deployment URLs, which change on every PR. If the suffix model
//  ever feels too loose, switch to an explicit hash-per-deployment allow
//  list.
//
//  Not used for outbound auth — auth is the `x-wakeproof-token` header
//  validated by the proxy. This guard only prevents the client from
//  talking to hosts other than our infrastructure in the first place.
//
